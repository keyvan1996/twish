## React: Cloud-Powered Apps with Firebase

![Made with Love](https://img.shields.io/badge/made_with-♥-ff69b4.svg)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Exercise files for LinkedIn Learning Course: [LINK HERE]

## Using the files

Once downloaded, run `npm install` in the `master` branch. you will only need to `npm install` once at the root of this project in order to install all of the dependencies.

The `master` branch contains the completed application, and the starting point for this course will be the branch `01-04-begin`. I recommend you start here and work together with me and build the entire application.

At any point, if you wish to see the files for a specific video, there is a branch you can use.

For example, if you are in Chapter 2, video 3, you can checkout the branch

```
git checkout 02-03-begin
```

If you wish to see the completed files for that particular video you can check out the branch

```
git checkout 02-03-end
```

When switching branches, make sure to either stash your changes or commit them.

For each video, you can check out the pull request I made to verify the changes match with your work: https://github.com/victormejia/react-firebase-dashboard/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

Lastly, there is sample data that you can use for your users, including sample profile images.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
